  <li>Accuracy of this model is 93.45%</li>
<br>
  <li>Tfid and Passive agressive algorithms are used in this.</li>
<br>
<li>Passive-Aggressive algorithms are generally used for large-scale learning. It is one of the few ‘online-learning algorithms‘. In online machine learning algorithms, the input data comes in sequential order and the machine learning model is updated step-by-step, as opposed to batch learning, where the entire training dataset is used at once. This is very useful in situations where there is a huge amount of data and it is computationally infeasible to train the entire dataset because of the sheer size of the data. We can simply say that an online-learning algorithm will get a training example, update the classifier, and then throw away the example.</li>
<br>
<li>TF-IDF are word frequency scores that try to highlight words that are more interesting, e.g. frequent in a document but not across documents. The TfidfVectorizer will tokenize documents, learn the vocabulary and inverse document frequency weightings, and allow you to encode new documents.</li>
